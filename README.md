## Overview
Create a simple Todo List application using React and TypeScript. This task is designed to be completed in 1 hour and tests fundamental React skills.

## Requirements

### Basic Features (Must Have)
1. Add new todos
2. Mark todos as complete/incomplete
3. Delete todos
4. List all todos

1. Filter todos by status (All/Active/Completed)
2. Add due dates to todos
3. Add priority levels (Low/Medium/High)
4. Add local storage persistence

## Technical Requirements
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Use React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Write clean, maintainable code
- Add basic styling (CSS/SCSS)

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser

## Evaluation Criteria
- Code organization and structure
- TypeScript usage and type definitions
- Component design and reusability
- State management
- Code readability and maintainability
- Basic feature implementation
- Bonus features implementation (if time permits)



### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
